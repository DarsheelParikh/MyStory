There once was a boy named Harold who lived next to an abanded shipyard. Harold was always told from a young age to never go anyewhere near that shipwreck, but one day when Harold was 12 years old, he went into the shipwreck. While searching through the ship, he heard thunder approaching outside, and he ignored it. Then he heard scary noises and thought he saw something. It was a ghost, Harold dashed off the ship and learned his lesson to disobey what people tell him.
